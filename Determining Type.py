#Determining Type

#Sometimes your code will raise a TypeError. These can be frustrating to fix. The first step is often to find out what type of data python thinks the object is.

#The way to find out what type of data python has stored in a variable is to use the type() method.n

#In the python IDE try the following:

my_variable = "A string"
print(type(my_variable))

#This should return:
<class 'str'>

#Once you know the type data, you can fix the issue by being explicit about how you want python to treat the data.

#Here is an example of a TypeError below.

my_number = 50
>>> some_string = "The number is "
>>> print(some_string + my_number)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str

#Here is how we can fix the TypeError by telling python to convert my_number to a string.

>>> my_number = 50
>>> some_string = "The number is "
>>> print(some_string + str(my_number))
The number is 50



my_variable = "A string"
print(type(my_variable))

my_number = 50
some_string = "The number is "
print(some_string + str(my_number))
